        <h2>Version 1</h2>
        <h4>Status: <strong style="color: green;">Implemented</strong><h4>
        <p>The file starts with <strong>a 32 bit version number</strong> as header. Following that are the content
            blocks
            Every block starts with a 32bit block header, this header can either be a block length or just additional
            information as well as UINT32_MAX (0xFFFFFFFF) which markes the content types end. This will change content
            type in the following order</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Textures</strong>
                <p>The header is the size of the texture file in byte. The texture file is a standard PNG file.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Materials</strong>
                <p>The header is the size of the following Material in byte. Currently this should either be 20 or 24.
                    The content consists of the <a href="./docs/Material.html">Material</a> data.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Actors</strong>
                <p>The header consists of the size of all the vertex data in the actor (<i>vertexCount</i> *
                    <i>vertexStride</i>).
                    The content starts with the properties of the <a href="./docs/Actor.html">Actor</a>. Following is
                    the 4 byte <i>indexCount</i>, an other 4 byte for <i>vertexCount</i>,
                    indexCount times 4 byte index values. Lastly the vertex data is appanded</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note: All values are unchecked by the reader, it assumes that data is transfered and baked correctly,
                this might change in further versions</strong></p>

        <h2>Version 2</h2>
        <h4>Status: <strong style="color: orange;">RFC</strong><h4>
        <p>The file starts with <strong>a 32 bit version number</strong> as header. Following that are the content
            blocks. Every block starts with a 32bit block header, this header can either be a block length or just
            additional information as well as <strong>UINT32_MAX (0xFFFFFFFF)</strong> which markes the content types
            end. Each content type starts with the <strong>32bit count</strong> of content blocks within this type.
            Optional content types can be decleared empty with the count being zero followed by the content type end
            marker. This will change content type in the following order:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Textures</strong>
                <p>The header is the size of the texture file in byte. The texture file is a standart PNG file.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Materials</strong>
                <p>The header is the size of the following Material in byte. Currently this should either be 20 or 24.
                    The content consists of the <a href="./docs/Material.html">Material</a> data.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Actors</strong>
                <p>The header consists of the size of all the vertex data in the actor (<i>vertexCount</i> *
                    <i>vertexStride</i>).
                    The content starts with the properties of the <a href="./docs/Actor.html">Actor</a>. Following is
                    the 4 byte <i>indexCount</i>, an other 4 byte for <i>vertexCount</i>,
                    indexCount times 4 byte index values. Lastly the vertex data is appanded</p>

            <li><strong>Animation</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Font</strong>
                <p>The header is the size of the font file in byte. The font file is a standard true type font file.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>UI Boundingboxes</strong>
                <p>The header is reserved for further use and should be 0. The content consists of 8 times 32bit float
                    values indicating 4 Points in a 2D plain, representing the actual Hitbox of a UI Actor. The
                    coordintaes should be homogeneous within a range of -1 to 1</p>
            <li><strong>Sampler</strong>
                <p>The header is reserverd for further use. The content consists of a
